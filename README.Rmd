# Introduction

Estimating kinship networks is data-demanding and mainly possible using empirical sources or demographic models. Empirical data, like population registers, provide a realistic picture but are scarce and limited by truncation and survivorship bias. Demographic models like microsimulation use aggregated data, but minimally account for population heterogeneity, family similarity and multipartner fertility. This study assesses the validity of kinship networks derived from microsimulation using Swedish population registers. We estimated the number of kin from grandparents to grandchildren for the Swedish population (cohorts 1915--2017) based on a SOCSIM microsimulation output and compared the results with the Swedish register counts from [@kolk_swedish_2023] .We use the SOCSIM demographic microsimulation program and data for Sweden from the [Human Fertility Collection (HFC)](https://www.fertilitydata.org/) (1751-1890), the [Human Fertility Database (HFD)](https://www.humanfertility.org/) (1891-2017), and the [Human Mortality Da ctabase (HMD)](https://www.mortality.org/) (1751-2017). Our results show that mean numbers and distributions of most kin are similar between the sources. The microsimulation produces slightly lower numbers of kin for cohorts unaffected by register truncation, but better accounts for kin from earlier cohorts that are under-registered due to missing parent-child links, conditioning on survival or migration. 

# Scripts for reproducible results

**NB**: If you want to re-run the analysis from scratch (i.e., retrieve the data from [HFC](https://www.fertilitydata.org/), [HFD](https://www.humanfertility.org/), and [HMD](https://www.mortality.org/)), run the microsimulations and reproduce the results), you need R, some standard packages, `HMDHFDplus` and `rsocsim`. 
Please, follow these steps:

1. Download this repository to your computer.  
2. Register at [HFD](https://www.humanfertility.org/) and [HMD](https://www.mortality.org/) and install `HMDHFDplus`.  
To write the input rate files and to compare the simulation results with the original input data, we use data from [HFC](https://www.fertilitydata.org/), [HFD](https://www.humanfertility.org/), and [HMD](https://www.mortality.org/). The last two are retrieved through the `HMDHFDplus` package. To gain full access to the databases, you need to become a registered user at both databases, after accepting the user agreement on their websites: <https://www.humanfertility.org/Account/Auth> and <https://mortality.org/Account/Auth>. 
3. Install `rsocsim`.  
Please go to <https://github.com/MPIDR/rsocsim> to find the instructions on how to install `rsocsim`.  
4. Open the provided RStudio project. 
5. Run the scripts sequentially in the order suggested by the numbers of the files (0-3). 
6. In scripts 0 and 1, please type your username and password for [HFD](https://www.humanfertility.org/) and [HMD](https://www.mortality.org/) in the corresponding space before running the code.  
7. To get exactly the same simulation results, you should use the same randomly generated seed mentioned in script 0.
